What is a Blog other than a message posting & retrieval system. Maybe you dont need all of these fancy one-size-fits-all blogs, you just want one that works with as little fuss as possible.

3 Django files (views.py, models.py, admin.py) and 1 Template file is all you need!

This Basic Blog will allow you to:
Create Messages
Specify if those messages are Viewable (if you want to save messages as a "Draft")
Create custom Tags for those messages
Auto-Sort the Tag list for future reference
Auto create a listing of all Tags for linking back to those particular messages
Auto create a Monthly Archive list for linking back to those particular messages
Each posting page uses the Post Title as the Page Title for increased SEO
Allow users to post Comments
User comments are saved to the DB as a NULL value, so that Comments need explicit approval from the Admin before they are visible
